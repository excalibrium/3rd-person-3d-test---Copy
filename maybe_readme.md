open source nothing burger !

we have :
	nothing!
	
	and by nothing, I mean a fully functional third person action system with weapon management, and combat with self made animations.
	
	obviously as bug-free as possible with more squashing on the way.
	
	featuring: pantheon and viego in a non-commercial test project! ! !
	
disclaimer:
	The project contains AI-assisted code that is maintained and fixed by human hands.
	
	Nothing is final, as in, this "everything" here is not final and is subject to modifications and alterations.
	

purpose:
	to learn, as it is the way to create something worth creating. And to save the world along the way, if possible! (in-game)
	
	to create a video game that is a sandbox for me, to shape it and create sandcastles with. A framework to build upon.
	
	

that is:
	it,
	for:
		now.
